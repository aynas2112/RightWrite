        Graphology is the pseudoscientific study and analysis of handwriting, especially in relation to human psychology. It suggests that one's handwriting can reveal a lot about their personality, emotions, and psychological state. It's important to note that graphology is not considered a legitimate or scientifically valid field of study by the mainstream scientific community.
